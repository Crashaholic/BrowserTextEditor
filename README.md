# In Browser Text Editor

This was more of a "what if", that was born out of just sheer curiosity. In this case, the thought was "what if I made a text editor that is entirely within the browser". I am aware that Visual Studio Code already does have an online version (IIRC anyways), but I still wanted to try my hand at writing this text editor. The eventual plan would be to have the same granular control over everything that Vim/Vi has, and be able to make custom keybinds and read from cookie or something. Said granular controls includes stuff like moving the cursor around, word wrapping, line numbers, status bar that NeoVim has, etc..

**THIS PROJECT WILL NOT BE ENTIRELY, ACTIVELY WORKED ON**

## Current Features
* Moving the cursor left and right
* Insert/overwrite mode
  * `<Insert>` to change mode
* Typing ASCII characters (alphanumeric + individual symbols)
